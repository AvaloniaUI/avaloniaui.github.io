{"name":"The Perspex UI Framework","tagline":"Cross platform .NET UI Framework with bindings and XAML","body":"### Current status\r\n\r\nWe're pleased to announce that Perspex is now in alpha!\r\n\r\nWhat does “alpha mean? Well, it means that it’s now at a stage where you can have a play and hopefully create simple applications. There’s now a Visual Studio Extension containing project and item templates that will help you get started, and there’s an initial complement of controls. There’s still a lot missing, and you will find bugs, and the API will change, but this represents the first time where we’ve made it somewhat easy to have a play and experiment with the framework.\r\n\r\n### How do I try it out\r\nThe easiest way to try out Perspex is to install the [Visual Studio Extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a4542e8a-b56c-4295-8df1-7e220178b873).\r\n\r\nThis will add a Perspex project template and a Window template to the standard Visual Studo “Add” dialog (yes, icons still to come :) ):\r\n\r\n![](http://grokys.github.io/images/2015-08-31-perspex-alpha/add-dialogs.png)\r\n\r\nCreating a Perspex Project will give you a simple project with a single XAML window. There’s currently no designer, and not even any type-checking or intellisense for Perspex’s xaml, but it works when you press F5, which is the important part!\r\n\r\n![](http://grokys.github.io/images/2015-08-31-perspex-alpha/hello-world-xaml.png)\r\n\r\nYou can also find the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/Perspex/Perspex/)\r\n\r\n### News\r\nYou can read news about Perspex on [Groky's blog](http://grokys.github.io/)\r\n\r\n### Cross Platform\r\nFow now we can run on Windows, Linux and Mac.\r\n![Mac](http://i.imgur.com/mUbdSKH.png)\r\n\r\n### Inspection support\r\n![Inspector](https://files.gitter.im/grokys/Perspex/Thxw/blob)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
